                                <h2>Wear a Mask!</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Masks are a simple barrier to help prevent your respiratory droplets from reaching others. 
                                    Studies show that masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You should wear a mask, even if you do not feel sick. This is because several studies have 
                                    found that people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are 
                                    not yet showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can still spread the virus to other people. Wearing 
                                    a mask helps protect those around you, in case you are infected but not showing symptoms.

                        <h2>Wash Your Hands Often!</h2>
                        <p>
                            Washing your hands is easy, and it’s one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of 
                            germs. Clean hands can stop germs from spreading from one person to another and throughout an 
                            entire community—from your home and workplace to childcare facilities and hospitals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs in most situations. If soap 
                            and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 
                            least 60% alcohol.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged 
                            period. Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their 
                            mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets 
                            can also be inhaled into the lungs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role 
                            in the spread of COVID-19. Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is 
                            important to stay at least 6 feet away from others when possible, even if you—or they—do not have any 
                            symptoms.

                        <h2>Get a COVID-19 Vaccine!</h2>
                        <p>
                            Vaccines are the best protection we have against many serious illnesses. They protect us from diseases 
                            by teaching our immune systems how to fight viruses and infections — without actually getting sick from 
                            the disease.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            COVID-19 can have serious and life-threatening complications, which is why it’s important for everyone 
                            who’s eligible to get vaccinated. If you’re not sure, ask your doctor if you should be immunized against 
                            COVID-19.
